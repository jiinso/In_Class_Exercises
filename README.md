Hello, my name is Jiin So. I am currently a sophomore at Gordon College studying Physics.

This repository contains the script files of in-class exercises done for one of my courses, PHY 371: Introduction to Programming For Computational Physics (IP4CS).

I may upload script codes with the word "advanced" in their names; this indicates that the script goes further than what was originally asked for in the exercise, from inspiration.
